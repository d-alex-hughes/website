What role do humans' social network connections play in shaping health
outcomes? It has been a privilege to be a part of a research team that
allowed me to leverage my social networks data collection and analysis
expertise to study questions related to health.

In particular, as a part of team led by James H. Fowler and Holly
Shakya, with important support from other scholars, we addressed
questions about the [flow of information about
treatment](http://fowler.ucsd.edu/social_network_targeting_to_maximise_population_behaviour_change.pdf),
beliefs about the [appropriateness of Intimate Partner
Violence](/assets/pdf/ShakyaHughes.2016.pdf), and [maternal and child
health](/assets/pdf/ShakyaStaffordHughes.2017.pdf).

Separately, as a part of a research team working in a high-immigration
town in Oaxaca, MX, I have been examining how migration and social
network support shape the prevalence of [depression and substance
abuse](/assets/pdf/Meacham.2016.pdf).
