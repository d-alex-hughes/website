Low cost methods to contact voters have long promised to change the
way campaigns contact, persuade, and mobilize voters. And yet,
scholars evaluating the effectiveness have never demonstrated any
positive results to mass email contact (Nickerson 2007).

provided email addresses as a part of their voter registration, either
reminding these voters of the upcoming election, priming the social
norm of voting as civic duty, or providing factual information about
groups of voters expected to turnout.

individuals who we contacted were _less_ likely to turnout than the
control group that received no contact.
