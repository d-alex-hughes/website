Results of an audit study conducted during the 2016 election cycle
demonstrate that the bias toward Latinos observed during the 2012
election has persisted. In addition to replicating previous results,
we show that Arabs face an even greater barrier to communicating with
local election officials. Our study did not produce evidence of
discrimination against blacks, a finding that echoes the results of
other recent studies. We examine one explanation for the high level of
discrimination against Arabs, that bureaucrats are politically
responsive. Our findings support this explanation. In geographies
that cast more votes for the Republican candidate, discrimination
against Arab names was stronger.

## Discrimination Against Latino Voters

Experimental evidence gathered in the 2012 General Election found that
when a Latino asked a question of his Local Election Official he was
less likely to receive a response than if a white man asked the _exact
same question_. We examine whether this pattern of discriminatory
behavior was limited to the 2012 election.

We find clear evidence that Latinos continue to pay a penalty. Name
alone is adequate to reduce the chances of receiving information about
how to vote by more than 3 percentage points.

## Discrimination Against Arab Voters

Not only do Latino voters receive answers to their queries at lower
rates: so too do voters who have Arab names. Indeed, an Arab name
alone is sufficient to decrease the probability of having an election
related question answered by more than 11 percentage points.

The magnitude of this result is arresting. Stated another way, if
simply because this question was asked by an Arab rather than a White
man, the request will be responded to only 3/4 as frequently.

## Political Pattern of Discrimination

The surprising size of the discrimination against Arab names led us to
investigate what mechanisms might be leading to such a large
discrepancy in treatment. As we show below, we found that
discrimination was considerably stronger in discrits that voted for
the Republican candidate. This suggests supports the theory that
street-level bureaucrats have considerable discretion in how they
execute the laws on the books.

    to Arab questions.
