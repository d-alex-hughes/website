What changes in peacebulding when a diverse set of decision makers are
involved in identifying the root causes of social conflict in their
communitites? Is it different than when traditional authoritites
perform the same task? What are the consequences, long-run, for the
successful creation of peace? 

In this project, together with Micah Gell-Redman (University of
Georgia) and Luis Camacho (National Opinion Research Center), I am working with
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
and Creative Associates to conduct a field experiment in 195
communitites in Guatemala's Western Highlands. Treatment communitites
will have additional incentives and training to drive the inclusion of
historically marginalized groups, namely women.

Project implementation will begin at the conclusion of the 2019
election cycle, apprpoximately September 2019.
