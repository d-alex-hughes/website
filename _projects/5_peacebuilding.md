What changes in peacebulding when a diverse set of decision makers are
involved in identifying the root causes of social conflict in their
communitites? Is it different than when traditional authoritites
perform the same task? What are the consequences, long-run, for the
successful creation of peace? 

In this project, together with Micah Gell-Redman, I am working with
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the
National Opinion Reseach Council (NORC), the Guatemalan USAID Mission,
and Creative Associates to conduct a field experiment in 200
communitites in Guatemala's Western Highlands.

Project implementation is scheduled to begin in late 2018, with the
first intervention and mid-line results measurement schedule to occur
in 2019.
