I am a post-doctoral researcher in the
[University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu)
[School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu). In 2016 I
received my PhD in Political Science from the
[University of California, San Diego](http://polisci.ucsd.edu). I also
studied at the University of Michigan where I graduated with a BA in
Political Science and a BA in Econometrics.

I research how group identity shapes access and behavior in
politics. Often, this takes the form of experiments. My research has
been published in _Perspectives on Politics_, _California Journal of
Politics and Policy_, _The Lancet_, _PNAS_,
and field journals.

Please see my [projects page](./projects) for more information about my research. 

I am proud to lead the multiply-awarded course _Experiments and Causality_ in the MIDS
program at UC Berkeley.
