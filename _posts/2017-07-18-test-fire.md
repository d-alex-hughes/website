description: What happens when you spend two days making a website?

What happens when one spends two days making a website? Learning about the hosting on GitHub, trying to come up to some sort of understanding of `ruby`? Well, the hope is that you're able to write blog-post in a markdown language and seamlessly push it to the site.

I did some lazy hacking around the internet on Sunday (while _jamming_ on a great coffee at [States Coffee](http://www.statescoffee.com)) and came across the framework that I think I'm eventually going to adpot.

This post is just a check to see that I can push in a reasonable way. I'll update the flow in the next post if this moves.
