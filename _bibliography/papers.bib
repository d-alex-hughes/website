  abstract={Experimental evidence in cognitive psychology and
                  behavioral economics is transforming the way
                  political science scholars think about how humans
                  make decisions in areas of high complexity,
                  uncertainty, and risk. Nearly all those studies
                  utilize convenience samples of university students,
                  but in the real world political elites actually make
                  most pivotal political decisions such as threatening
                  war or changing the course of economic
                  policy. Highly experienced elites are more likely to
                  exhibit the attributes of rational decision making;
                  and over the last fifteen years a wealth of studies
                  suggest that such elites are likely to be more
                  skilled in strategic bargaining than samples with
                  less germane experience. However, elites are also
                  more likely to suffer overconfidence, which degrades
                  decision making skills. We illustrate implications
                  for political science with a case study of crisis
                  bargaining between the US and North
                  Korea. Variations in the experience of US elite
                  decision-makers between 2002 and 2006 plausibly
                  explain the large shift in US crisis signaling
                  better than other rival hypotheses such as “Iraq
                  fatigue.” Beyond crisis bargaining other major
                  political science theories might benefit from
                  attention to the attributes of individual
                  decision makers.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
